DESCRIPTION:

MEDIA:
https://ibb.co/bssTjkP

FEEDBACK - 	Stakeholder 1 says button's text is not centered.

				- Could incoroprorate the text rendering into the button class
					- This would be more modular and easier to use,
						could create a "TextRectButton" class
						
			Stakeholder 2 says button colour is obnoxious to look at.
			
				- Could be fixed by using less saturated colors
					could use a color picker to get a rgb value that looks better
				- Use complimentary colors and use correct
					font colors for accessibility
